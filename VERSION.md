## v3 — Custody Cycle Correctness

### v3.04 — Brief storyboard rework: artifact filter + scrapbook redesign + multi-photo gallery
`pending` — 2026-06-21
- **New table `event_artifacts`** (migration 049). Parent-captured moments tied to events — three optional inputs (photo, mood enum, short note), `≥1 must be non-null` constraint, mood vocabulary locked at `loved / fun / ok / tired / upset / sick`. Family-scoped RLS with author-only mutation. Indexes for event-pull, child-timeline, family-album, and photo-only album. Reuses existing `snapshots` storage bucket
- **`generate_brief()` rewritten** (migration 050). New filter rules: `activity / friend_visit / appointment / manual` always show; `school` only when an `event_artifacts` row exists for the child + event; `pickup / dropoff` never show. 5-day cap baked into the auto-derived window (was client-side only). New `had_handoff` flag in the return shape. Single grouped return shape `{ since, child_id, had_handoff, events: [{ ..., artifacts: [...] }], last_handoff }`
- **Brief modal rewritten end-to-end**. Store `generateBrief` now calls the RPC and returns the grouped shape natively. `BriefModal.vue` consumes events grouped by calendar day with day-spine headers. Photos resolved to signed URLs per artifact id. Warm empty state ("All quiet since you saw [name]"). Scrapbook-shape skeleton loader during fetch
- **New components** `BriefStoryCard.vue` + `BriefMoodChip.vue`. Story card handles the multi-artifact case — hero photo + 56px thumb strip below for 2+ photos, taps swap the hero with a 200ms crossfade. Mood chips render emoji + Hebrew/English label with opaque cream base + tinted overlay (visible over any photo background) + soft drop shadow
- **Design language doc** at `docs/design/brief-storyboard.md` (gitignored — internal). Variant B "Scrapbook Tape" picked from `/design-shotgun`. All tokens scoped to `--brief-*` so the global Becket system stays intact
- **Scrapbook chrome.** Each card has deterministic rotation by index (±0.7 to ±1.2° in LTR, sign flips in RTL), washi-tape strip with deterministic per-index x-position spanning the full card width, hand-drawn ink-pen wavy underline on titles. "Quiet mode" auto-applies when an artifact mood is `upset` or `sick` — halves rotation, drops the ink underline, calms the tape
- **Capture pivot (Decision #3 in plan).** Original plan had a notification-triggered standalone capture modal. Reshaped to ride on existing DropoffModal + PickupModal flows. Phase 1c (the modal extensions) is the next chunk — not in this PR
- **Translations.** EN + HE additions for 6 mood labels, 7 day names, `briefFrom`, `briefEmptyHeroPrefix`, `briefEmptySub`. Hebrew "אהבה / כיף / בסדר / עייפ/ה / עצובה / חולה" mapped to the locked slugs

### v3.03 — Next handoff respects school model; stale status falls back to cycle
`pending` — 2026-06-20
- **getNextHandoff school-day model fixed.** Under the v2.08+ model the school event lives on the INCOMING custody day (kid sleeps with outgoing parent, drops at school next morning, incoming parent picks up after school). The handoff scanner was still looking at the OUTGOING day for school — so transitions with school on the next day fell back to "pickup at default morning time" instead of "pickup at school end". Now scans on the incoming day; handoff date is always the incoming day either way
- **getEffectiveStatus staleness.** DB `current_status` overrode the cycle indefinitely — a confirm action months ago kept the child stuck `with_dad` even as the cycle rolled to mom. Now if `status_changed_at` is on an earlier calendar day than today (or null), the DB status is treated as stale and the cycle takes over. Same-day explicit actions still win (e.g., a pickup confirmed this morning legitimately overrides the cycle until tomorrow)

### v3.02 — Child card "next interaction" reads live from store
`pending` — 2026-06-20
- Before: ChildCard read `child.nextHandoffTime/Type/Loc/Date` — fields baked onto the child object once, inside `loadFamilyData()`. Any change to events or custodySchedule (calendar edits, cron re-runs, the wipe+regenerate from 047/048) didn't propagate; the card kept showing the stale handoff until the user fully reloaded the app
- Removed those snapshot fields from the children map. ChildCard now calls `dashboardStore.getNextHandoff(child.id)` inside a Vue computed → Vue tracks reactive deps on `events`, `custodySchedule`, `defaultHandoffTime`, etc. and re-evaluates automatically
- Added a `nowTick` ref bumped every 60s (alongside the existing status refresh) so the computed also re-evaluates as time passes — a handoff whose time has elapsed drops out without needing an event change
- `getNextHandoff` exposed from the store

### v3.01 — Sunday-aligned SQL helper + school-first generation order
`pending` — 2026-06-20
- SQL custody helpers (`get_custody_parent_id`, `get_custody_parent`) treated cycle_data[0] as the parent on valid_from's actual weekday. The UI editor and calendar treat cycle_data[i] with i%7=day_of_week (0=Sun..6=Sat). Mismatch by `valid_from.dow` days — cron-generated handoffs and trustee-generated school events landed on the wrong custody days; calendar showed transitions the JS view said weren't transitions
- Migration 047 rewrites both helpers to shift epoch to the Sunday on/before valid_from, then wipes + regenerates all future custody_cycle / trustee_schedule events with the corrected helper
- Migration 048 swaps the order inside `generate_recurring_events` (trustee first, custody second) so the school-supersession guard in `generate_custody_events` actually sees school events when it runs. Plus a re-run of the same supersession cleanup
- Verified live: every upcoming school event's `dropoff_by` / `pickup_by` matches the JS calendar's per-day custody; zero custody handoffs remain on days with an active school event

## v2 — Onboarding & Dashboard Personalization

### v2.10 — School supersedes custody handoff (no more duplicate events)
`pending` — 2026-06-20
- Before: the daily cron's `generate_custody_events` created an evening dropoff (18:00) and a morning pickup (08:00) on every custody transition — regardless of whether school existed. Once schools were added, the calendar showed BOTH the school event AND a redundant pair of handoffs for the same day; parents got asked to confirm a handoff that doesn't actually happen
- `generate_custody_events` now checks per-child: if the INCOMING custody day already has a school event for that child, both the outgoing-evening dropoff and the incoming-morning pickup are skipped. School owns the handoff
- Migration 046 also cleans up FUTURE custody_cycle pickup/dropoff events that are already superseded by an existing school event (per-family timezone). Past events left untouched

### v2.09 — School events: configurable owners + calendar display (Wave 2 — UI)
`pending` — 2026-06-20
- School setup ([EntityFormModal](src/components/trustees/EntityFormModal.vue)) gains a "Who takes me?" block with per-schedule Drop-off / Pickup selectors (Previous day's parent / Current day's parent)
- `trustee_schedules.dropoff_owner` + `pickup_owner` columns added (migration 045); generator reads them per-school instead of hard-coding the rule
- Existing school schedules backfilled with the typical default: drop-off = prev day, pickup = current day; activities default to current/current (generator ignores for now)
- [EventDetailModal](src/components/family/EventDetailModal.vue) for school events now shows two rows — 🚗 Drop-off and 🚪 Pickup — with the resolved parent name (calling name or Dad/Mom)
- New `resolveParentDisplayName(profileId)` helper in dashboard store
- EN + HE translations: whoTakesMe, dropoffByLabel, pickupByLabel, ownerPrevDay, ownerCurrentDay, assignParentNeeded

### v2.08 — School events: drop-off / pickup split (Wave 1 — schema + generator)
`pending` — 2026-06-20
- Events table gains `dropoff_by` and `pickup_by` (uuid → profiles); school events now carry both, expected_by mirrors pickup_by for status-engine compat
- `generate_trustee_events` sets dropoff_by = previous-night's custody parent (sleep-with), pickup_by = current-day custody parent; non-school types unchanged
- Split-custody days leave the affected slot NULL — UI assignment lands in Wave 2
- `pending_actions` unique-pending index widened to (target_type, target_id, reason) so `swap_dropoff` and `swap_pickup` can be requested independently on the same event
- Backfill: future school events get the new slots filled per family timezone; past events untouched

### v2.07 — Calendar parenting-time: lazy cycle resolution + correct fallbacks
`pending` — 2026-06-20
- Custody schedule now computes lazily via a Proxy from the cycle config (epoch + length + per-day labels); no pre-filled window, so navigating to any past or future month always shows parenting time
- Removed the 100-day window that silently capped coloring once a cycle aged past three months
- `getCustodyForDate` no longer defaults missing schedule entries to 'mom' (which made every cell look orange when data was absent); returns 'no-custody' instead
- `resolveCustodyLabel` returns null for unrecognized values instead of leaking a raw profile_id UUID as a CSS class
- Added `.split` and `.no-custody` styling across month / week / day views; day-view banner now hides on non-custody days instead of falsely showing "mom Home"

### v2.05 — Usage step card layout matches type step
`pending` — 2026-02-24
- Usage cards now vertical grid (same as type selection cards)
- Image on top, title, description, toggle underneath each card
- 3-column for separated, 2-column centered for together/solo

### v2.04 — Usage step icons, profile menu label, separated image
`pending` — 2026-02-24
- Add section icons (finance/management/understandings) to onboarding usage cards
- Match AppHeader modal layout: icon + body + toggle
- Shorten profile dropdown label to "My Setup" / "ההגדרות שלי"
- Change separated type card image to two-homes (button_house2.png)

### v2.03 — Onboarding polish: merge steps, human-focused copy
`pending` — 2026-02-23
- Merge Type + Situation into single step (agreement inline for separated)
- Remove Challenges step entirely (derive from dashboard prefs)
- Rename Dashboard → Usage with problem-focused descriptions
- Remove "Family & Trustees always included" note
- All family types now 5 steps: Type → Profile → Usage → Currency → Plan
- Updated EN + HE copy: "Expenses & Costs", "Schedules & Tasks", "Parenting Agreements"

### v2.02 — Dashboard Setup in profile menu
`pending` — 2026-02-23
- New "Dashboard Setup" item in profile dropdown menu
- Toggle modal: enable/disable Finance, Management, Understandings
- Saves to Supabase instantly, footer + router update in real-time
- Auto-redirects to /family if current route becomes disabled

### v2.01 — Onboarding rebuild: family types, challenges, dashboard prefs
`pending` — 2026-02-23
- New 3-type funnel: Separated (7 steps), Together (6 steps), Solo (6 steps)
- Challenges multi-select per family type (communication, scheduling, etc.)
- Dashboard preference toggles: Finance, Management, Understandings (optional)
- Three-layer enforcement: router guard + footer + family data
- Direct URL to disabled dashboard → redirects to /family
- Dynamic AppFooter: satellite positions for 2/3/4/5 items
- New DB columns: family_type, dashboard_prefs (jsonb), challenges (jsonb)
- Migration 030: backfills existing families (all dashboards ON, no breakage)
- Null-safe nullable columns (relationship_status, agreement_basis)
- 94 new translation keys (EN + HE)
